By default, we can log into the shell using the user root with the password opnsense to operate the live environment via the local console.
After successfully booting up with the OPNsense Full Image (DVD, VGA, Serial), the firewall will be at the Live Environmentâ€™s login: prompt.
To start the installation process, login with the:
user installer
password opnsense
If Importer was used to import an existing configuration, the installer and root user password would be the root password from the imported configuration.
