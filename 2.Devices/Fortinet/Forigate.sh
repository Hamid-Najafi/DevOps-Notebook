# FortiGate VDOM Structure 
# -------==========-------
1. Global VDOM
    Control plane for the system.
    Used for interface assignment, logging, and management overview.

2. MGMT VDOM
    Dedicated for device management (GUI/CLI access, FortiManager, etc.).
    No Internet access, no default route.
    Prevents the device from being blocked due to Iran IP exposure.
    If access to other VDOMs is needed, only explicit access, policies can be created from the root VDOM.

3. root VDOM
    Default VDOM for all production traffic.
    All firewall policies, routing, NAT, VPN, and security profiles are configured here.

4. Other VDOMs (if created)
    Can be used for separation (e.g., DMZ, Datacenter).
    Do not mark them as management VDOM.

âœ… Rule of thumb:
    Use root VDOM for all real network/security configs.
    Use MGMT VDOM only for secure device management.
    Global VDOM stays as system-level control.
